Description of Scripts
main.py: Imports functions from setup.py, anomize.py, and minutagg.py and executes them in sequence to process the dataset.
setup.py: Loads the dataset and prints its basic details.
anomize.py: Anonymizes the biker column in the dataset and filters out entries with a time value of "00:00:00".
minutagg.py: Groups times in the dataset into 00, 20, or 40-minute intervals and plots a histogram of the grouped times.

Example
When you run main.py, it will:

Load the dataset and display the first 5 entries.
Anonymize the biker names and display the first 5 entries after anonymization.
Group the times and display the first 15 entries of the dataset with grouped times.
Plot and save a histogram of the time groups.
